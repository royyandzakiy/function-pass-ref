# Function Pass by Reference

This example shows how functions can be passed by reference to dynamically be called

Output:
```
function-pass on  master took 2s ❯ ./funcpass 
initial value of a : 100
initial value of b : 200
After addByTen, value of a : 110
After addByTen, value of b : 210
After swap, value of a : 210
After swap, value of b : 110
```
